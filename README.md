# Process of developing a task (FRONTEND)
## Discussion of functional requirements for a task or a feature

1. Dmitry should choose a task or a feature for developing a developer
2. Iuliia should make a discussion call with Dmitry, Aleksandr, Sofia and developer who should implement the task or the feature
3. On this call all members should discuss functional requirements and decomposing the task or the feature. After it all should define all dependencies inside the task or the feature and discuss points which should be develop

## Decomposing the task or the feature

1. The developer should decompose the task into points, each point should be estimated by time in hours. 
2. The resulting list must be agreed with Dmitry. 
3. It is necessary to take into account bug fixing in the estimate as a certain percentage of the total time for completing the task. 
4. After agreeing on the hours that are planned to be spent on the implementation of the task/ feature, the developer must begin working on it.

## For both points should be spent no more than 48 hours. 

## Start working 
1. After agreeing on the hours that are planned to be spent on the implementation of the task/ feature, the developer must begin working on it.
2. If something need from backend team you should write it in the common chat about it and ask Aleksand to develop smth needs

## Requirements for codding
1. https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/
2. Indents before curly brackets on level 1 must be set in 1 line (always!). Even in a structure with 1 field, it must be separated by a space line above and below. This requirement applies only to level 1. If the structure also contains a function, then indentation is no longer needed in it. 
3. Functions with more than 1 parameter, each parameter must be written on a new line (always!). If the function has 1 parameter, then it can be written in 1 line. If 2, 3, etc., then each must be written on a separate line. In this case, the call to such a function does not necessarily have to be on multi-lines

## Requirements for sending merge request for approving 
1. Need to make MR and send it to Dmitry
2. Need to recorder a video screen cast of a resolving task and send it to Dmitry. It helps him understanding whatâ€™s solving in this MR

## Resolving a task
1. The task is accepted as completed after it has been checked by a tester in the stage environment and has no bugs or comments.
